1. Data collection frequency not be too high
Reducing the frequency of data capture would reduce the amount of data to be transmitted and, hence reduce network load.Sensors work only during specified situations.

2.Specified time slot transmission
Through this , sensors communicate during specified time slots only and not continuously.
This method also prevents data overflow from all nodes simultaneously and overall helps in the structured flow of data.

3.Advanced sampling techniques
These sensors are able to alter their data capture rate according to the surrounding activity and distractions.
